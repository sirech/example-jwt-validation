# Hello World API: SpringBoot + Kotlin Sample

You can use this sample project to learn how to secure a simple [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) API server using Auth0.

The `starter` branch offers a working API server that exposes three public endpoints. Each endpoint returns a different type of message: public, protected, and admin.

The goal is to use Auth0 to only allow requests that contain a valid access token in their authorization header to access the protected and admin data. Additionally, only access tokens that contain a `read:admin-messages` permission should access the admin data, which is referred to as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/).

[Check out the `add-authorization` branch]() to see authorization in action using Auth0.

[Check out the `add-rbac` branch]() to see authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in action using Auth0.

## Get Started

The only dependency is having `java` installed. You can install like this on OS X:

```bash
brew install openjdk@11
```

There's a `go` script that you can use to execute the different tasks.

### Running the application

Use:

```bash
./go run
```

### Executing the unit tests

Use:

```bash
./go test
```

### Additional targets

There are two additional targets, `./go build` and `./go containerize`, in case you want to package the app in a Docker container.

## API Endpoints

The API server defines the following endpoints:

### ðŸ”“ Get public message

```bash
GET /api/messages/public
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API doesn't require an access token to share this message."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get protected message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0.

```bash
GET /api/messages/protected
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully validated your access token."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get admin message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0 and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

```bash
GET /api/messages/admin
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "message": "The API successfully recognized you as an admin."
}
```

## Error Handling

### 400s errors

#### Response

```bash
Status: Corresponding 400 status code
```

```json
{
  "message": "Message that describes the error that took place."
}
```

### 500s errors

#### Response

```bash
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
```

```json
{
  "message": "Message that describes the error that took place."
}
```
